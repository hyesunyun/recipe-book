To prepare the tofu: Drain the tofu and use your palms to gently squeeze out some of the water. Slice the tofu into thirds lengthwise so you have 3 even slabs. Stack the slabs on top of each other and slice through them lengthwise to make 3 even columns, then slice across to make 5 even rows. Line a cutting board with a lint-free tea towel or paper towels, then arrange the tofu in an even layer on the towel(s). Fold the towel(s) over the cubed tofu, then place something heavy on top (like another cutting board, topped with a cast iron pan or anything weighty) to help the tofu drain. Let the tofu rest for at least 10 minutes (preferably more like 30 minutes, if you have the time). Transfer the pressed tofu to a medium mixing bowl and drizzle with the olive oil and tamari/soy sauce. Toss to combine. Sprinkle the starch over the tofu, and toss the tofu until the starch is evenly coated, so there are no powdery spots remaining. Add the tofu onto prepared baking sheet and arrange the tofu in an even layer. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing the tofu halfway, until the tofu is deeply golden on the edges.

Pour the mixture into prepared baking pan and spread in an even layer and bake about 20 minutes or until lightly golden around the edges. While the crust is baking, in a blender or a bowl add the lemon juice, lemon zest, strawberry puree, eggs and sugar. Blend or mix until smooth. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and blend for another 15 sec or until smooth. Pour over the hot crust when it\u0026rsquo;s finished baking and bake for additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is lightly golden. Cool completely and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Garnish each bar with a slice of strawberry. Doubled the original recipe because the bars came out pretty flat. Also, reduced some of the sugar content.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","description":"Strawberry Lemonade Bars","permalink":"https://hyesunyun.github.io/recipe-book/recipes/strawberry-lemonade-bar/","tags":["bars","strawberry","lemon","dessert"],"title":"Strawberry Lemonade Bars"},{"contents":"Makes about 5-6 pancakes depending on size.\nIngredients Pancake Batter 1 bunch of scallions cut into thin, 1 inch length 1/2 onion thinly sliced 1-2 large carrots julienned 1 red pepper julienned 1 cup of frozen seafood mix (can also do diced shrimp, squid - calamari, diced imitation crab) 500g of Korean pancake mix (부침가루)1 800ml of water oil as much as you need for frying Dipping Sauce 2 Tbsp sugar 4 Tbsp soy sauce 2 Tbsp vinegar (I use rice vinegar) 1 Tbsp of Korean pepper powder (gochugaru - 고추가루) chopped green chilis for some extra kick! Directions Wash and prepare all the pancake batter ingredients (veggies and seafood). In a bowl, combine the Korean pancake mix and water together. Whisk together until there are no clumps. Mix in the chopped seafood and vegetables to the batter. On Medium High heat, add 2-3 Tbsp cooking oil. When heated, pour a small amount of batter. Just create your desired size/shape! Lower the heat depending on how the pancake is doing. Continue with the remaining batter and be generous with the oil. Having enough oil is key to a crispy pancake! Make the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Another trick that some folks do is to mix Korean pancake mix and Korean frying mix (튀김가루) 1:1 ratio to create a crispier pancake.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","description":"Easy Korean Seafood Scallion Pancake","permalink":"https://hyesunyun.github.io/recipe-book/recipes/easy-korean-seafood-scallion-pancake/","tags":["korean","seafood","pancake"],"title":"Easy Korean Seafood Scallion Pancake"},{"contents":"Makes 4 servings.\nIngredients 3 Tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced1 1 Tbsp tomato paste 1 tsp ground cumin 1/4 tsp ground black pepper 1/2 tsp ground chile powder or cayenne pepper, more to taste2 1 quart of chicken or vegetable stock (leaving out the added 2 cups of water from original recipe3) 1 cup red lentils 2~3 large carrots, peeled \u0026amp; diced salt to taste juice of 1/2~1 lemon 3 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro Directions In a large pot, heat 3 Tbsp olive oil over high heat until shimmering.
