[{"contents":"Makes about 5-6 pancakes depending on size.\nIngredients Pancake Batter 1 bunch of scallions cut into thin, 1 inch length 1/2 onion thinly sliced 1-2 large carrots julienned 1 red pepper julienned 1 cup of frozen seafood mix (can also do diced shrimp, squid - calamari, diced imitation crab) 500g of Korean pancake mix (부침가루)1 800ml of water oil as much as you need for frying Dipping Sauce 2 Tbsp sugar 4 Tbsp soy sauce 2 Tbsp vinegar (I use rice vinegar) 1 Tbsp of Korean pepper powder (gochugaru - 고추가루) chopped green chilis for some extra kick! Directions Wash and prepare all the pancake batter ingredients (veggies and seafood). In a bowl, combine the Korean pancake mix and water together. Whisk together until there are no clumps. Mix in the chopped seafood and vegetables to the batter. On Medium High heat, add 2-3 Tbsp cooking oil. When heated, pour a small amount of batter. Just create your desired size/shape! Lower the heat depending on how the pancake is doing. Continue with the remaining batter and be generous with the oil. Having enough oil is key to a crispy pancake! Make the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Another trick that some folks do is to mix Korean pancake mix and Korean frying mix (튀김가루) 1:1 ratio to create a crispier pancake.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","description":"Easy Korean Seafood Scallion Pancake","permalink":"https://hyesunyun.github.io/recipe-book/recipes/easy-korean-seafood-scallion-pancake/","tags":["korean","seafood","pancake"],"title":"Easy Korean Seafood Scallion Pancake"},{"contents":"Makes 4 servings.\nIngredients 3 Tbsp olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves, minced1 1 Tbsp tomato paste 1 tsp ground cumin 1/4 tsp ground black pepper 1/2 tsp ground chile powder or cayenne pepper, more to taste2 1 quart of chicken or vegetable stock (leaving out the added 2 cups of water from original recipe3) 1 cup red lentils 2~3 large carrots, peeled \u0026amp; diced salt to taste juice of 1/2~1 lemon 3 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro Directions In a large pot, heat 3 Tbsp olive oil over high heat until shimmering.
