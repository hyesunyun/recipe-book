To prepare the tofu: Drain the tofu and use your palms to gently squeeze out some of the water. Slice the tofu into thirds lengthwise so you have 3 even slabs. Stack the slabs on top of each other and slice through them lengthwise to make 3 even columns, then slice across to make 5 even rows. Line a cutting board with a lint-free tea towel or paper towels, then arrange the tofu in an even layer on the towel(s). Fold the towel(s) over the cubed tofu, then place something heavy on top (like another cutting board, topped with a cast iron pan or anything weighty) to help the tofu drain. Let the tofu rest for at least 10 minutes (preferably more like 30 minutes, if you have the time). Transfer the pressed tofu to a medium mixing bowl and drizzle with the olive oil and tamari/soy sauce. Toss to combine. Sprinkle the starch over the tofu, and toss the tofu until the starch is evenly coated, so there are no powdery spots remaining. Add the tofu onto prepared baking sheet and arrange the tofu in an even layer. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing the tofu halfway, until the tofu is deeply golden on the edges. ",

Pour the mixture into prepared baking pan and spread in an even layer and bake about 20 minutes or until lightly golden around the edges.

Directions Wash and prepare all the pancake batter ingredients (veggies and seafood). In a bowl, combine the Korean pancake mix and water together. Whisk together until there are no clumps. Mix in the chopped seafood and vegetables to the batter. On Medium High heat, add 2-3 Tbsp cooking oil. When heated, pour a small amount of batter. Just create your desired size/shape! Lower the heat depending on how the pancake is doing. Continue with the remaining batter and be generous with the oil. Having enough oil is key to a crispy pancake! Make the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Another trick that some folks do is to mix Korean pancake mix and Korean frying mix (튀김가루) 1:1 ratio to create a crispier pancake.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n",
