Makes enough for single 4in. cheese form or three 2in. cheese forms.
Can also make for four 4in. cheese forms.

## Ingredients

**For single 4" cheese form or three 2" cheese forms**
- 4 cups of whole milk (do not use Ultra Pasteurized Milk)
- 1/2 tsp of powdered rennet
- salt to taste
**For four 4" cheese forms**
- 1 Gallon of whole milk (do not use Ultra Pasteurized Milk)
- 2 tsp of powered rennet
- salt to taste 

## Directions

1. Heat milk on low until lukewarm (about 97Â°F). Do not overheat the milk. Once milk is at desired temperature add powdered rennet and mix well.
2. Once rennet is fully dissolved remove pan from heat and set aside for 30-45 minutes for milk to coagulate and begin to form curds.
3. Place cheese form(s) on a plate with a lip (or wide bowl) to hold excess whey that will release over time. As the milk coagulates, use a slotted spoon to fill the forms with curds.
4. As the curds set in their form(s) liquid whey will slowly pour out of the holes in them. Press down carefully on the curds to help press out the whey. This helps create a firmer cheese.
5. Sprinkle salt to taste and refrigerate overnight.
6. The following day, place another plate over your form and carefully flip the cheese upside down over a sink to drain out all excess whey that has collected. Then place the plate back in the refrigerator for another 24 hours. Repeat this step if necessary, cheese should be ready to eat on the third day.
