- 2 Tbsp kimchi juice (optional)
- 1/2 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp Korean chili pepper flakes
- 1 cup rice water[^1]

## Directions

1. Dice kimchi into large pieces if it isn't already cut. Cut tofu into rectangles. Slice the onions, scallions, and green chili.
2. In a heated pot, add the perilla oil and some oil/juice from the tuna can. Then add the kimchi, onion, and sugar. Fry the ingredients until the onion turns translucent.
3. Add the water (rice), minced garlic, pepper flakes, tuna, and kimchi juice to the pot and let it boil for 5 minutes in medium heat.
4. Add the scallions, green chilis, and tofu and let it boil a bit more. The longer it boils, the better it tastes.
5. Serve with rice warm.
