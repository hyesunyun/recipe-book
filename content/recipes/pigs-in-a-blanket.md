## Ingredients

- 2 cans (8 oz) refrigerated Pillsbury Original Crescent Rolls (8 count)
- 48 cocktail-size smoked link sausages or hot dogs (from two 14-oz packages)

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 375Â°F. Unroll both cans of the dough; separate into 16 triangles. Cut each triangle lengthwise into 3 narrow triangles.

2. Place sausage on shortest side of each triangle. Roll up each, starting at shortest side of triangle and rolling to opposite point; place point side down on 2 ungreased cookie sheets.
3. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown, switching position of cookie sheets halfway through baking. Immediately remove from cookie sheet. Serve warm.

**Tips**
- Work in batches so the refrigerated dough stays chilled. Make the first 2 dozen crescent dogs using one can of dough before removing the second can from the refrigerator.
- Line cookie sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
- Try setting up a condiment bar to serve with these Mini Crescent Dogs. Set out small bowls of ketchup, chili sauce, your preferred mustard and a creamy horseradish sauce. All of these options will complement the smokiness of the crescent roll mini hot dogs.
