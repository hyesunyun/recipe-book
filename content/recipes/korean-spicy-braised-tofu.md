Makes about 4 servings.

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 1 tofu block
- 1/4 cup of water
- salt
- olive oil or some vegetable oil for frying

### Sauce Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp gochugaru (고추가루)
- 3 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp mirin (맛술)
- 1/2 Tbsp sweetner (plum syrup or sugar)
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 3 Tbsp chopped scallion/green onions
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil

## Directions

1. Cut the tofu into rectangle slices. Use a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Lightly salt the tofu. This is to ensure that the tofu stays firm and cooks well with the sauce.
2. Next, make the sauce. Place all the sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well.
3. In a well-heated frying pan, add some cooking oil. Don't be too stingy with the oil.
4. Then, add the tofu slices. Make sure they are not overlapping. Fry them both sides until golden yellow.
5. After the tofu is fried to a golden color, add the sauce evenly on top of the tofu.
6. Add approximately 1/4 cup of water to the pan.
7. Reduce the heat to medium. Feel free to use a spoon to evenly cover the tofu with the sauce. Let the liquid evaporate a bit.
8. Serve with rice.
