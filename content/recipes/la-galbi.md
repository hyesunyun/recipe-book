Makes 4 servings.

## Ingredients

- 3-4 pounds cross-cut beef short ribs (flanken or LA galbi cut) about 1/3-inch thick

### Marinade

- 1/2 Korean/Asian pear (or 1 apple), grated or blend the next 3 ingredients in a blender or food processor
- 2 Tbsp. minced garlic (about 6 plump cloves)
- 1/2 medium onion, grated
- 1 tsp. minced ginger (about 1 inch chunk)
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup water
- 3-4 Tbsp. sugar (can reduce sugar and add more pear or Korean plum syrup)
- 2 Tbsp. honey
- 1/4 cup cooking rice wine (mirin)
- 2 Tbsp. sesame oil
- 3 scallions finely chopped
- 1/2 tsp. black pepper
- 1 tsp. sesame seeds (Optional)

## Directions

**For the ribs:**

1. Rinse the ribs to wash off bone dust and remove some blood on the surface. Place the ribs in a large bowl with water and add a tablespoon of sugar to the water with the ribs. This helps with remove blood from the ribs and creating better tasting ribs. Soak for about 20 minutes.

**For the marinade:**

1. Blend the pear (or apple) together with the onion, garlic, and ginger in a blender or food processor. Mix all the marinade ingredients well in a large bowl or container.
2. Add the meat to the marinade and coat each rib with the marinade. Marinate the meat for 6-8 hours (overnight for best results). Flip them over half way through. The thicker the meat, the longer you’ll want to marinate.

**Cooking the ribs:**
1. *Grilling*: Preheat the grill over medium-high heat. Grill the short ribs, turning only once, 2-3 minutes on each side. You can use charcoal or wood charcoal (soot bul) grill, gas grill, or a grill pan over the stove top.
2. *Broiling in the oven*: Set the oven to broil and preheat. Lay the meat in a single layer on a broiling pan and place it on the top rack of the oven, usually about 6 inches below the broiler. Cook until the ribs are slightly charred and caramelized, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip them over and cook for an additional 3 – 4 minutes. Watch closely not to burn them.
3. *Pan-frying*: Preheat a large non-stick pan. Reduce the heat to medium. Lay the short ribs in a single layer, 4 or 5 ribs depending on the size of the pan. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes. When the pan is getting dry. Add the marinade through a strainer. Flip them over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes until all the sauce is gone and the ribs are nicely browned.
