Makes 2 servings.

## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp oil
- 2 Tbsp doenjang (Korean soybean paste)
- 1.5 Tbsp ssamjang (Korean dipping sauce)
- 1/2 Tbsp gochujang (Korean pepper paste)
- 1/2 Tbsp gochugaru (Korean pepper flakes)
- 500 ml/16.9 oz rice water
- 1/3 diced onion
- 1/3 diced zucchini
- 1 chopped green onion/scallion

## Directions

1. In a pot coated with oil (1 Tbsp), stir fry doenjang (2 Tbsp), ssamjang (1.5 Tbsp), gochujang (1/2 Tbsp), and gochugaru (1/2 Tbsp) for a minute in low heat so the sauce doesn't burn.
2. Pour rice water (500 ml/16.9 oz) into the pot and mix it well and turn it to high heat.
3. Once it starts boiling, put handful of onion (1/3), zucchini (1/3), and white part of green onion (1) and boil until the onion softens.
4. Now, put chopped tofu (1/2) and a little bit of green onion/scallion.
