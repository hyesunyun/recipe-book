2. Add the Korean pancake mix, 1/3 cup kimchi juice, and 1/2 Tbsp of minced garlic to the bowl with the kimchi. Add 2/3 cup of water. Mix the batter. Adjust the level of water by adding more water or more pancake mix to get the right consistency. 
3. Fry the pancake batter with oil in a pan. Cook on both sides until golden brown.
