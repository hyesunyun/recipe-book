## Ingredients

### Sweet Shortcrust Pastry
- 6 ounces butter (softened)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- pinch salt
- 1/4 tsp almond extract

### Filling
- 4 cups milk
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 eggs
- 3 Tbsp cornstarch
- 3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- pinch salt
- 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon

## Directions

### for the crust

1. Preheat oven to 350째F (177째C). Grease a pie dish and set aside.
2. Cream the butter and add the sugar. Beat in the egg and almond extract. Stir in the flour and salt. Knead until a soft dough has formed. Chill for 10 minutes.
3. Roll the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and layer it into a greased pie dish. Cover with a sheet of parchment paper and fill the void with pie weights. Bake blind at 350째F (177째C) for 15 minutes or more. Make sure the crust is fully cooked. Remove parchment and pie weights. Allow crust to cool completely on a wire rack.

### for the filling

1. In a heat proof bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, cornstarch, flour and vanilla extract. Set aside.
2. In a medium size saucepan, heat the milk and butter at medium setting. Do not bring to a rolling boil.
3. Add about a fourth of the milk to the egg mixture, whisking to incorporate it evenly. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan with the remainder of the milk. Return to heat and stir constantly until it thickens. Do not boil! This part may take a long time. Be patient!
4. Pour the filling into the pie crust and let cool completely. Refrigerate until serving. Sprinkle with cinnamon on the top of the custard before serving.
