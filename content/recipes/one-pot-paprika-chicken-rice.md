Makes 4 servings. Adapted from https://simplehomeedit.com/recipe/one-pot-crispy-chicken-and-red-rice/

## Ingredients

### Chicken
- 1.2 kg (2 lb 10 oz) bone-in chicken thigh cutlets, skin on (5–6 chicken thigh cutlets)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp dried herbs (oregano, thyme or Italian herb mix)
- 1 tbsp sweet paprika
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp cracked black pepper
- 1/2 tsp sea salt flakes
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp tomato paste (concentrated puree)
- 1.5 cups (300 g) white rice (jasmine or basmati)
- 3 cups (750 ml) chicken stock
- Fresh coriander (cilantro) or flat-leaf (Italian) parsley, roughly chopped, to serve (optional)

### Cucumber Salad

- 3 Lebanese (Persian) cucumbers, finely sliced
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1/2 tsp sea salt flakes 
- 1/2 tsp cracked black pepper 
- 3 tbsp sour cream

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) (all oven types).
2. In a large bowl, coat the chicken with olive oil, dried herbs, sweet paprika, onion powder, smoked paprika, black pepper and salt. Use your hands to ensure even coverage.
3. In an oven-safe, heavy-based frying  pan, sear the chicken on medium heat for 3–5 minutes until golden and crispy. Set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the onion and garlic (see note 2 if the pan is sticky). Cook for 1–2 minutes until softened. 
5. Add the tomato paste and rice, stirring to combine. Pour in the chicken stock.
6. Return the chicken to the pan, ensuring the skin is facing up. Cover the pan tightly with a lid or foil. Bake for 35 minutes in the oven.
7. Remove the cover and bake for another 10 minutes. Allow the dish to rest, covered, for 10 minutes before serving, and top with fresh herbs if using.
8. To make the cucumber salad, combine all ingredients and serve with the chicken and rice.

## Notes

### What can I serve with One-pot Paprika Chicken and Rice?

This meal pairs well with just about anything! The suggested cucumber and sour cream salad is a refreshing addition, but you could also serve it with steamed greens like broccoli, broccolini (tenderstem broccoli), green beans, snow peas (mangetout) or kale. A fresh green salad or roasted vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, pumpkin/butternut squash, zucchini/courgette, eggplant/aubergine, brussels sprouts or capsicum/bell peppers) would be great too. For an extra creamy option, a dollop of Greek yoghurt or tzatziki works beautifully, as would a sprinkle of creamy feta!

### Can I use boneless chicken thighs instead of bone-in chicken thigh cutlets?

Yes! Whole boneless chicken thighs can be used in this One-pot Paprika Chicken and Rice. Sear the chicken thighs as per the recipe, then set aside. Follow the recipe, but do not return the chicken thighs to the pan. Cook the rice, covered, for 20 minutes first, and then add the chicken. Cook for a further 15 minutes, covered, then cook for an additional 10 minutes, uncovered, and finally leave to stand for 10 minutes before serving, as per the recipe.

### Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?

Yes, but you’ll need to adjust the cooking time. Brown rice takes longer to cook, so increase the oven cooking time by 15–20 minutes, and add 1 additional cup (250 ml) of chicken stock (4 cups/1 litre total). Make sure the rice is cooked through before serving.

### How can I spice it up?

Add ½ teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper or dried chilli (red pepper) flakes to the chicken marinade, or finish with a sprinkle of dried chilli flakes or a drizzle of chilli oil.
