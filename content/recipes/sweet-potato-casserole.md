## Ingredients

- 3 pounds sweet potatoes (peeled and cut into cubes)
- 1/2 cup brown sugar (packed)
- 1/3 cup salted butter (softened)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup chopped pecans (divided)
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon (or to taste)
- salt and black pepper (to taste)
- 2 cups miniature marshmallows

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375F. Grease a 9 x 13 pan.
2. Place sweet potatoes in a pot of boiling water. Simmer for 15 minutes or until fork tender. Drain.
3. In a large bowl (or in the pot the potatoes were cooked in), mash the sweet potatoes with brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, vanilla and salt & pepper.
4. Fold in half of the pecans and spread into prepared pan.
5. Sprinkle with the marshmallows and the remaining pecans.
6. Bake for 25 minutes or until marshmallows are golden brown and potatoes are heated through.

**Note**
- Light or dark brown sugar can be used.
- If using unsalted butter, add extra salt if needed.
- This can be made up to 48 hours ahead of time.
    - Prepare and refrigerate before baking, keeping the topping in a separate container.
    - Remove the sweet potato casserole from the fridge at least 30 minutes before baking. Bake for 20 minutes and then stir.
    - Add the topping and cook for 15-20 minutes longer or until heated through and the marshmallows are toasty.
