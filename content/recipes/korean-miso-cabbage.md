Makes about 4 servings.

## Ingredients

- 6 leaves of large napa cabbage
- 1 Tbsp doenjang - Korean soybean paste (된장)
- 1/2 Tbsp gochujang - Korean pepper paste (고추장)
- 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1/2 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds
- 1~2 tsp sugar
- 2 Tbsp chopped scallion/green onions

## Directions

1. Chop the napa cabbage leaves into large chunks after thoroughly washing. Boil a pot of water and blanch them in high heat. Make sure that the cabbage is cooked through and is dark green.
2. While the cabbage is cooking, add all the sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix.
3. Once cooked, remove the cabbage from the pot and drain with cold water. Make sure to squeeze the cabbage to remove most of the water. We just don't want a super wet cabbage.
4. Add the cabbage to the sauce and mix well. Make sure the sauce is evenly coated.
