Makes enough for 8-10 rolls

## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 Tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 Tbsp reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp honey or maple syrup (for vegan version)
- 1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 2 to 3 Tbsp water, as needed

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, rice vinegar, tamari, honey, sesame oil, and garlic.
2. Whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons water, as needed to make a super creamy but dip-able sauce.
3. Serve the spring rolls with peanut sauce on the side.

*MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE*: Be sure to use tamari (not soy sauce, which typically contains gluten).

*MAKE IT PEANUT FREE*: Substitute almond butter (if not avoiding nuts altogether) or sunflower seed butter for the peanut butter.
