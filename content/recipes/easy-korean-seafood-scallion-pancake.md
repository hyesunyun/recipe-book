- 800ml of water
- oil as much as you need for frying

### Dipping Sauce
- 2 Tbsp sugar
- 4 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp vinegar (I use rice vinegar)
- 1 Tbsp of Korean pepper powder (gochugaru - 고추가루)
- chopped green chilis for some extra kick!

## Directions

1. Wash and prepare all the pancake batter ingredients (veggies and seafood).
2. In a bowl, combine the Korean pancake mix and water together. Whisk together until there are no clumps.
3. Mix in the chopped seafood and vegetables to the batter.
4. On Medium High heat, add 2-3 tbsp cooking oil. When heated, pour a small amount of batter. Just create your desired size/shape! Lower the heat depending on how the pancake is doing.
5. Continue with the remaining batter and be generous with the oil. Having enough oil is key to a crispy pancake!
6. Make the dipping sauce by mixing all the ingredients together.
