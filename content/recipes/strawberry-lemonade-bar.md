Makes 24 servings[^1].

## Ingredients

### Crust
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 cup butter (2 sticks) **room temperature**
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Filling
- 2 cups fresh lemon juice (10-ish lemons)
- 4-6 tsp lemon zest
- 1/2 cup pureed strawberries about 1 1/2 cup berries
- 2 cups sugar (can do slightly less)
- 8 large eggs
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease or line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, beat together sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Add flour and salt and mix until the mixture is crumbly.
3. Pour the mixture into prepared baking pan and spread in an even layer and bake about 20 minutes or until lightly golden around the edges.
4. While the crust is baking, in a blender or a bowl add the lemon juice, lemon zest, strawberry puree, eggs and sugar. Blend or mix until smooth. Add flour, baking powder, and salt and blend for another 15 sec or until smooth.
5. Pour over the hot crust when it's finished baking and bake for additional 30-35 minutes or until the top is lightly golden.
6. Cool completely and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Garnish each bar with a slice of strawberry.

[^1]: Doubled the original recipe because the bars came out pretty flat. Also, reduced some of the sugar content.
