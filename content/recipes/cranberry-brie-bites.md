## Ingredients

- all-purpose flour (for dusting the dough and cutting board)
- 8 ounce crescent dough sheet (or crescent rolls)
- 8 ounce wheel of brie cheese
- 1 cup whole berry cranberry sauce (not jellied)
- fresh rosemary sprig (only need about 2)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F degrees. Spray a 24 count mini muffin tin with cooking spray. Spread a little all-purpose flour out onto your counter or cutting board. Then roll out 8 ounce crescent dough sheet. If using crescent rolls, pinch the seams together to make one long sheet.
2. Cut crescent roll dough into 24 equal-sized squares.
3. Place squares into muffin tin slots.
4. Cut 8 ounce wheel of brie cheese into small pieces and place inside the crescent dough squares.
5. Top with a generous spoonful of whole cranberry sauce.
6. Then add a small piece of fresh rosemary sprig to each one.
7. Bake until the crescent dough is a light golden brown (about 15 minutes). Then serve warm!

**Notes**
- Some folks like to cut off the rind to the brie. This isn’t necessary with brie but feel free to remove that additional rind if that is your taste preference.
- If you don’t have a 24 count muffin tin, just use what you have (probably a 12 or 18 count tin.) You will just have to do it one at a time.
